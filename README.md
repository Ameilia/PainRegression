Transferring Face Verification Nets To Pain and Expression Regression

Requirements

1. My Caffe (https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/tree/ms). If you don't want to train with class-balance sampling ([image_data_layer.cpp](https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/blob/ms/src/caffe/layers/image_data_layer.cpp)) nor observing Pearson Correlation during training ([correlation_loss_layer.cpp](https://github.com/happynear/caffe-windows/blob/ms/src/caffe/layers/correlation_loss_layer.cpp)), you may use the official Caffe.
2. Matlab,
3. GPU with CUDA support
